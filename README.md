# AIris
# Mac Version

- An Artificial Intelligence Bot written in Python and Rivescript

- It has a command line mode and a speech mode

- For installation see 'requirements.txt'

# Usage:
- Type 'python main0.7.py' in Terminal
- The program asks for your Username (this name will be used to store your variables, ie. name, age, etc.).
- Then choose between command line mode or speech mode.
- Now the bot is ready to accept your input. Your chat history and your variables will be saved in a JSON file, so that once you log back (using the same Username) they will be restored and the bot will know it's you.
